"""
check_enrollment.py
--------------------
Diagnoses why a student isn't being recognized. Walks student_photos/
exactly the way detection_system.py does, and reports per student:
  - whether the folder name is valid (must be <id>_<name>)
  - how many photos were found
  - how many of those photos actually had a detectable face

A student with 0 detected faces will NEVER be recognized, even though
their folder exists — this is the #1 cause of "added them but it's not
detecting" issues.

Run this from the project root:
    python check_enrollment.py
